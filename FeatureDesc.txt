The Premise of this project is a profit calculator for over the road trucking

The goal of this project is to provide a trip planner for truckers that includes options for
calculating the total profit that will be made during a specific route. The user will begin by creating an account.
From there they will create a trip and enter in the beginning and ending destinations with accompanying mileage.
From there they will enter a bunch of subsequent information including but not limited to,

Fuel tank capacity
Fuel mileage
Mileage rebate (if offered by their company)
Price of the load.
Other costs such as tolls and other things.

And when all that is entered in the user will then submit this information, where the website will take all those values
and calculate the net profit that the driver will recieve at the end of the route.

Depending on the logged in user they will be able to track a list of trips theyve taken and will ge aggrigate information about 
their driving habits such as average fuel mileage, trip distance, fuel cost, etc to give a net profit of all the trips that user has entered
